This:
airport.loadMap(new Airport.OnLoadMapCallback() {

      ...
   }
});

Becomes:
Map map = airport.addMap();

  - The MapView constructor has been replaced with a new asynchronous method on the Map called addMapView.  Upgrade
    example:

This:
mapView = new MapView(context,map);

Becomes:
map.addMapView(new Map.OnMapViewReadyListener () {
   public void mapViewReady(MapView mapView) {
       ...
   }
});
